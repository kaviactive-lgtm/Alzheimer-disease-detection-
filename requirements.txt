# ===================================================================
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION:
#
# 1. DO NOT run "pip install -r requirements.txt" immediately.
#    You must install PyTorch manually first using the special command.
#
# 2. Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
#    and find the correct command for PyTorch 2.1.0 that matches your
#    system (CPU or a specific CUDA version for your NVIDIA GPU).
#    Run that command.
#
# 3. After PyTorch is installed, you can install the rest of the
#    packages by running:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
